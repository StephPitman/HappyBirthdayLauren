# HappyBirthdayLauren
Happy  24th birthday Lauren!

Hope your 24th trip around the sun is even better than the last. I am excited to be able to celebrate your birthday in person, once COVID goes away! I can see it being a giant geek EXTRAVAGANZA!

Your passion for everything you do is both amazing AND inpiriing. You make the most difficult things seem so simple, and are so modest about it. You even do things just to put a smile on other face, and I know that everyone around you appreciates that so much. Like the one time you learned Jason Derulo's "If I am Lucky" because I was humming it! That brought a giant smile to my face and happiness to my heart!

I am so lucky to have met you during head start before university, so happy to have been able to stay such good friends since, and so excited to see what the future has for our friendship! 

Thank you for being you!

-Steph :)
